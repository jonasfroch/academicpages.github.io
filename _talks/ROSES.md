I had the pleasure to present my [working paper](https://jonasfroch.github.io/publication/relocation) at ROSES. I emebed the discussion on the intangible impact of a major league franchise in the local context of the departure of the Rams from St. Louis, delve into the relocation history, and unravel the local idiosyncratic factors underlying the role sports in general, and the Rams in particular play or played for the city of St. Louis. I embed the case study in a broader discussion on the public subsidization of stadium projects. While I find that the Rams generated substantial implicit amenety value in St. Louis, the magnitude effect is still not large enough to derive a compelling argument going beyond partial subsidies.
